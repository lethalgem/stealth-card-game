## Description:
Embark on a stealth adventure like no other in "Sneaky Link," a unique card-based stealth game set in an enchanting outdoor forest filled with shrines and secrets. Designed by the dynamic duo of SuperMB13 and Lethalgem, this game combines the thrill of stealth with the strategic depth of card games, offering an innovative gameplay experience. Developed for the Mini Jame Gam #28 under the theme of "grow," Sneaky Link incorporates the essence of growth not just through its flowery objectives but also through the expanding possibilities as you combo your way through challenges. Build the biggest combo you can and grow your played card stack mile high!

## Lore:
In a mystical realm where the forest whispers ancient secrets, three sacred flowers hold the key to unlocking an age-old shrine's mysteries. Legends speak of these blooms as the heart of the forest, embodying the pure essence of nature itself. However, guardians roam the woods, protectors of the sacred, who will stop at nothing to ensure the flowers remain untouched. As a cunning adventurer, you must outwit these guardians, using stealth, strategy, and a bit of magic to collect the flowers and uncover the secrets they guard.

## Gameplay:
Sneaky Link is a turn-based stealth card game where strategy and cunning are your best tools. Players navigate through a beautifully rendered forest map, using a deck of three types of cards: Movement, Combo, and Flower.

* Movement Cards: Allow you to move your character to any tile on the map that is the distance listed on the card, enabling you to sneak past guardians or position yourself strategically.
* Combo Cards: These cards are the core of your strategic depth, allowing you to play as many cards as the number on the combo card. Mastering combos can set up powerful turns.
* Flower Cards: Reveal the hidden locations of the three sacred flowers. All three must be discovered and collected by simply moving near them to win the game.
Beware, for the guardians patrol the map. Being spotted means instant failure, forcing you to rely on your wits and the strategic use of your cards to remain unseen.
